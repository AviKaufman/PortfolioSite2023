      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Avi Kaufman, a passionate technologist and researcher with a triple major
        in Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics at the University of Iowa, projected
        to graduate in May 2025. I've embarked on an academic and professional journey defined
        by rigorous research, creative problem-solving, and an unquenchable thirst
        for innovation.
      </p>
      <h4>A Quantum Leap into Machine Learning</h4>
      <p>
        In the forefront of my current explorations is Quantum Computing,
        particularly its fascinating convergence with machine learning.
        I'm part of a cutting-edge research group where I delve into the
        complexities of Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (qRNNs).
        My goal is ambitious: to harness the power of quantum computing
        to revolutionize long-term memory in neural networks.
        By meticulously comparing qRNNs with their classical counterparts,
        we're on a quest to uncover breakthroughs that could redefine
        cognitive computational tasks.
      </p>
      <h4>Bridging Theory and Practicality</h4>
      <p>
        My academic path has been a blend of theoretical study
        and hands-on experience. I've designed algorithms, untangled
        data structures, and immersed myself in computer organization and
        machine architecture. Notably, my contributions to the DUNE project
        within the Iowa Physics Department involved developing neural networks
        to decode the mysteries of neutrino interactions, a testament to my
        ability to synthesize complex concepts into tangible outcomes.
      </p>
      <h4>Leadership and Teamwork</h4>
      <p>
        I thrive in leadership as evidenced by my past role as the Temple
        Youth Group President, where I fostered community and spearheaded
        collaborative projects. These experiences honed my ability to motivate
        teams towards common goals, a skill I believe to be just as critical as
        technical expertise.
      </p>
      <h4>Life Beyond Code</h4>
      <p>
        There's more to me than research and algorithms.
        I'm an avid basketball player, a fitness enthusiast,
        and a competitive gamer—ranked in the top 1000 for online Minesweeper
        and formerly an active competitor in Fortnite.
        My hobbies, like watching anime or diving into educational YouTube rabbit holes,
        reflect my broader curiosity and my pursuit of continual learning.
      </p>
      <h4>Dreams and Ambitions</h4>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, my ambition is to pioneer innovative technologies
        or start a venture that has a meaningful impact on the world.
        My hyperfocused nature ensures that I push the boundaries of perfection
        in everything I engage with, whether that's refining a project or mastering a new game.

        <br>

        Join me on this journey of discovery and invention. Let's connect, collaborate,
        and create something extraordinary together.
