      <h2>Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)</h2>
      <p>
        From December 2021 to August 2023 I worked with Dr. Jane Nacthman on the
        DUNE project. To the right is a video presentation of my project that I
        worked on during that time. Below is a brief description of the project.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), supported by the
        Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF), is an international endeavor
        hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fermilab. DUNE brings together
        scientists and engineers from more than 35 countries around the world,
        all sharing the same goal: to understand the neutrino, one of the most
        elusive and mysterious subatomic particles in the universe.

        <br /><br />

        What will studying the neutrino tell us? These particles are everywhere
        in our universe, rarely interacting with matter. Trillions pass through
        us every second without leaving a trace. In nature, they are produced in
        great quantities by the sun and other stars. They have been with us
        since the earliest moments of the universe, and may carry the answers to
        some important questions: What is the origin of matter? What is the
        relationship between nature’s forces? How do the most extreme objects of
        our galaxies form? And how did we come to exist at all?

        <br /><br />

        To answer these questions, scientists are building the most advanced
        system to generate and detect neutrino particles ever conceived. The
        effort involves a world-leading new particle accelerator (part of the
        PIP-II project), an upgraded neutrino beam (provided by the LBNF
        project) and a world-class experiment (built by the DUNE collaboration).
        DUNE includes a sophisticated particle detection system at Fermilab and
        the massive particle detector modules to be installed a mile beneath the
        surface at Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota. Once
        PIP-II, LBNF and DUNE are complete, scientists will send trillions of
        neutrinos 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) through the earth, with no tunnel
        required, and study them when they interact in detectors on both ends of
        that journey.

        <br /><br />

        With two DUNE prototype detectors operating at CERN, LBNF construction
        work underway in South Dakota and at Fermilab, a PIP-II test accelerator
        operating at Fermilab and components being built around the world, this
        effort is taking shape now. The next few decades will bring untold
        scientific discoveries, and DUNE, LBNF and PIP-II will be central to
        making those discoveries possible.
