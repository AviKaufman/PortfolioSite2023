        <h2>Quantum Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently working with Dr. Yannick Maurice (pictured to the
          right) on Quantum Machine Learning. I started with the group in
          October 2023 and plan to have a paper published by May 2024.

          Development and Analysis of Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (qRNNs)
          for Enhanced Long-Term Memory
        </h2>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>
            Quantum machine learning (QML) represents an emerging frontier
            where quantum computing and machine learning (ML) intersect.
            The field promises to harness the principles of quantum mechanics
            to process information in ways that classical computers cannot,
            potentially revolutionizing our computational capabilities and
            problem-solving strategies.
          </p>
          <h4>Quantum Computing: A Primer</h4>
          <p>
            At the heart of quantum computing lies the quantum bit or qubit,
            which, unlike a classical bit, can exist in a state of superposition—being
            in a combination of 0 and 1 simultaneously. This property, along with entanglement
            and quantum interference, enables quantum computers to process vast
            amounts of data more efficiently than classical computers for certain tasks.

            <br><br>

            Quantum computing has evolved rapidly since the first ideas proposed
            by Richard Feynman and others in the late 20th century, which suggested
            that a computer based on quantum principles could simulate physical systems
            more naturally than a classical computer.
          </p>
          <h4>Machine Learning: An Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence,
            involves the development of algorithms that can learn from and
            make predictions or decisions based on data. Classical ML has
            seen widespread application—from voice recognition systems
            to medical diagnosis—by leveraging statistical methods to find
            patterns in large datasets.
          </p>
          <h4>Quantum Machine Learning: Synergizing Two Fields</h4>
          <p>
            Quantum machine learning seeks to exploit quantum
            algorithms to improve upon the machine learning
            tasks performed by classical computers. This involves
            both using quantum systems to model classical data and
            applying classical ML concepts to better understand and utilize quantum systems.
          </p>
          <h4>Proposal</h4>
          <p>
            Quantum computing has gained considerable traction in augmenting
            machine-learning algorithms, especially in an era dominated by noisy
            intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. One notable research,
            "Quantum Reservoir Computing Using Arrays of Rydberg Atoms,"
            showcased the potential of a quantum RNN (qRNN) as an effective
            computational model that leans into the inherent Hamiltonian
            dynamics of spin-1/2 particles. Particularly, this model exploited
            quantum many-body scars, hinting at its potential in cognitive tasks
            such as long-term memory.

            <br><br>

            My objective is to recreate and further explore the qRNN model
            for long-term memory applications and establish a comparative
            performance analysis with classical RNNs.
